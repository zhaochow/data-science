# Data Science

Repository describing my adventure into data science. It compiles my projects as well as useful materials related to this field.

## Projects

### Classification

### Regression

### CV (Computer Vision)

- [Imagenette Classification](cv/imagenette_classification.ipynb): Classify pictures from [Imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) under various constraints (e.g. 128px images, 5 epochs, training from scratch).

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)

- [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](nlp/toxic_comment_classification.ipynb) ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)): Detecting the type(s) of toxicity (e.g. threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate) of a comment using a LSTM model without pre-trained embeddings.
