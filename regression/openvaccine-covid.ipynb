A brief summary is given below (from the competition itself).\n","\n","mRNA vaccines have taken the lead as the fastest vaccine candidates for COVID-19, but currently, they face key potential limitations. One of the biggest challenges right now is how to design super stable messenger RNA molecules (mRNA). Conventional vaccines (like your seasonal flu shots) are packaged in disposable syringes and shipped under refrigeration around the world, but that is not currently possible for mRNA vaccines.\n","\n","Researchers have observed that RNA molecules have the tendency to spontaneously degrade. This is a serious limitation--a single cut can render the mRNA vaccine useless. Currently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to being affected. Without this knowledge, current mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 must be prepared and shipped under intense refrigeration, and are unlikely to reach more than a tiny fraction of human beings on the planet unless they can be stabilized.\n","\n","In this competition, the goal is to develop a models which predicts likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule. We are given a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position. The model is scored on a second generation of RNA sequences that have just been devised by Eterna players for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.\n","\n","This kernel was mainly used for learning purpose. The models are inspired from those of the Kaggle community. In particular, RNN-based (LSTM & GRU) models and embeddings are used.\n","\n","At the end of the competition, the best model is the one presented in this notebook: 0.42265 private LB (top 61%), 0.25281 public LB. It didn't perform very well but it was great learning material. It is also interesting to note that downscaling the final results will yied a higher score (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/discussion/189182 for more information).\n","\n","References:\n","- https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/gru-lstm-with-feature-engineering-and-augmentation\n","- https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/openvaccine-simple-gru-model\n","-
